BJP's Telangana state unit president Bandi Sanjay Kumar sparked a row on Tuesday with his comment that after BJP's victory in Greater Hyderabad civic polls, surgical strikes will be carried out on the old city.

While campaigning for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections, the BJP leader stated that after BJP wins the polls and its leader becomes the Mayor, surgical strikes will be carried out on the old city to drive away pro-Pakistan elements and Rohingyas.

"After a BJP leader becomes the Mayor, we will do surgical strikes on the old city to chase away Pakistan supporters and Rohingyas," the MP from Karimnagar said during a road show in Habsiguda.

He alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) are trying to win the GHMC polls with Rohingyas, Pakistani and Afghanistani voters.

"Surgical strike on Hyderabad? Has this person gone completely insane for a few votes and seats," tweeted Telangana cabinet minister and TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao.

He asked Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy, if he condoned his colleague MP's reprehensible and hate-filled statements.
