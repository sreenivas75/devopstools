Anna Salai, GST Road and Kathipara junction were among the locations that witnessed traffic snarls and several places came under sheets of water and vehicles moved at a slow pace.

While social media users shared videos of flooded roads like the Tiru-Vi-Ka Salai and Wall Tax Road, stagnant rain water at locations including the Kathipara point was pumped out by Chennai Corporation workers and they also removed 90 uprooted trees.

Police teams patrolled the city roads and people who turned up at the popular city and suburban beaches like the Marina and Neelangarai were dispersed by police personnel.

Meanwhile, Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani visited the Greater Chennai Corporation’s control room at the Rippon Building headquartes for a review meet and flagged off a ‘Mobile Command and Control Centre’ van as part of measures to tackle the situation.
